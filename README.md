# Sl-Assignment

1.Create a simulator for the heap management schema using linked list

2.After the creation of the heap management schema, write a code and implement the following
  garbage collection methods to find the garbage nodes in the given heap.
  
  a.Reference Counting method
  
  b.Mark and Sweep method (mark all the nodes of the tree using constant space (i.e. without
    using either recursion or a stack)
    
3.Display the output for both the methods in the form of the adjacency matrix separately. Also show
  the garbage nodes that are no longer required.
      
4.For the garbage nodes, implement the merge memory technique of free space management
  and make sure that the adjacent blocks are merged together. Display the size of the freed and
  merged memory in terms of bytes
